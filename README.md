# ASB_Challenge-1
This was a challenge proposed in class. Open to updates.

This script was made with the intent of preparing a search using Etools API giving as output a .fasta file aligned and ready to make a philogenetic tree out of. 
As input this script uses the database type (tested only using nucleotide db) and search terms.
The terms used for testing where from an article published by Akihito that we studied in class.
